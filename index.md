Imagine that we work at a bank. When we receive a loan application, we need to make sure that if we give the money, the customer will be able to pay it back. Every application carries a risk of default — the failure to return the money. We’d like to minimize this risk: before agreeing to give a loan, we want to score the customer and assess the chances of default. If it’s too high, we reject the application. 

We will study different machine learning models and we will select the best one for our proyect.
