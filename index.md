<p align="justify">
Imagine that we are working at a telecom company that offers phone and internet services, and we have a problem: some of our customers are churning. They no longer are using our services and are going to a different provider. We would like to prevent that from happening, so we develop a system for identifying these customers and offer them an incentive to stay.
<br><br>
First, I carry out a deep exploratory data analysis for analying relationships between data. Then, I preprocess the data and I do some feature engineering. Finally, I train a Logisctic Regression model selecting the best hyperparameters that fit better for the application and I analize its performance.

<p align="justify">
Imagine that we work at a bank. When we receive a loan application, we need to make sure that if we give the money, the customer will be able to pay it back. Every application carries a risk of default, the failure to return the money. We’d like to minimize this risk: before agreeing to give a loan, we want to score the customer and assess the chances of default. If it’s too high, we reject the application.
<br><br>
First, I carry out a brief exploratory data analysis. Then, I preprocess the data and do some feature engieering. Finally, I train different machine learning models to see wich one fits better for the application: Logistic regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM and XGBoost.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors Image classification

<p align="justify">
The main goal of this proyect is to build a image classification model for the rock, paper and scissors game. 
<br><br>
First I prepare the data using generators for image augmentation. Then, I use a pretained model called Inception-v3 and we add some extra layers to fit the model for the application. For training the model I use the Rock Paper Scissors Dataset and then, the model is evaluated using unseen images.

## Resources

### NumPy library

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/numpy_summary.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/jorgealiaga36/machine-learning/blob/main/numpy_summary.ipynb)

<p align="justify">
NumPy is a library for adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
<br><br>
This notebook shows the main functions of the NumPy library. These are related with implementing different mathematical operations, sorting, reshaping or slicing NumPy arrays and much more.

<p align="justify">
Pandas is a library used in data analysis and in data manipulation for retrieving information from the data.
<br><br>
This notebook shows the main functions of the Pandas library. These are related with creating Data Frames and Series, grouping or sorting them, dealing with missing values, and much more.
