The main goal of this proyect is to apply machine learning to `predict churn in a telecom company`.

Imagine that we are working at a telecom company that offers phone and internet services, and we have a problem: some of our customers are churning. They no longer are using our services and are going to a different provider. We would like to prevent that from happening, so we develop a system for identifying these customers and offer them an incentive to stay.

First, we carry out a deep exploratory data analysis for analying relationships between data. Then, we preprocess the data and we do some feature engineering. Finally we train a `Logisctic Regression` model selecting the best hyperparameters that fit better for our application and we analize its performance.

The main goal of this proyect is to apply machine learning to `predict whether a customer will fail to pay back a loan` (default prediction).

Imagine that we work at a bank. When we receive a loan application, we need to make sure that if we give the money, the customer will be able to pay it back. Every application carries a risk of default — the failure to return the money. We’d like to minimize this risk: before agreeing to give a loan, we want to score the customer and assess the chances of default. If it’s too high, we reject the application. This process is called “credit risk scoring".

First, we carry out a brief exploratory data analysis. Then, we preprocess the data and do some feature engieering. Finally, we `train different machine learning models` to see wich one fits better for our application:

+ `Logistic regression`.
+ `Decision Trees`.
+ `Random Forest`.
+ `SVM`.
+ `XGBoost`.

The main goal of this proyect is to `build a image classification model for the rock, paper and scissors game`. 

First we prepare the data using generators for image augmentation. Then, we use a pretained model called `Inception-v3` and we add some extra layers to fit the model for our application. For training the model we use the Rock Paper Scissors Dataset and then, the model is evaluated using unseen images.

NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
